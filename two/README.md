# Debugging Challenge: Two

Challenge Two is is comprised of a single server application using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) ("The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines"). The problem here is that the server will not start.

The objective is to ensure the server starts up and that you can navigate to the home page at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Running the project

To run the project, all that's required is opening your terminal and `cd`ing into the root directory of the project and executing `docker compose up`.

## Requirements

1. [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
